                <p>With in my past years as a developer, I have been able to accomplish some major works.
                 I've already contributed to over a dozen projects and assisted with managing one project in my time at microsoft.
                I have also done and am still doing tons of projects for my individual or organization customers in my time as a freelancer.

                <article class="part-2-2">
                    <h2 id="1st-work">Pixel-Sense</h2>
                    <p> A multitouch table top computer from Microsoft that incorporates hand gestures and 
                        optical recognition of objects placed on the screen. Introduced in 2008 as the 
                        Surface computer with a 30" screen, the PixelSense's 40" screen is used without a 
                        mouse and keyboard and is large enough for group participation. 
                        Subsequent products from Microsoft adopted the Surface brand.
                        In 2012, Microsoft acquired Perceptive Pixel Inc., the maker of these devices.</p>
                    <h2 id="2nd-work">skype translator</h2>
                    <p>Unveiled during the 2014 Recode Conference, Skype Translator is a near real-time translator app. 
                        It will allow you to talk in your native language to people who speak in a different language.
                        The app will do the translation and speak it out to them. 
                        The project was a culmination of several different projects from Microsoft Research, 
                        from machine translation to speech recognition. The app is expected to be released in beta in late 2014.</p>
                    <h2 id="3rd-work">Pictionaire version 4</h2>
                        Amongest the biggest works that I have done the best is this one.
                        Pictionaire is a system that can turn a table or any other object into a multi-touch computer, 
                        allowing the user to manipulate digital objects using their fingers. 
                        It can also turn real objects placed on the table into a virtual object; 
                        the user then can manipulate it with digital tools. 
                        The technology involves the use of a DSLR camera on top of the table that will take 
                        a picture of the physical item and then digitize it. I was able to contribute at the software part of
                        this project. </p>
                    <h2 id="4th-work">website development</h2>
                    <p>I have been able to build websites for major companies of our country like CBE, Bunna bank, 
                        BGI, Medroc ethiopia, Nib bank, Brihan bank, Ethiopian Insurance coorporation and Anbessa and 
                        and many other insurance companies. and As a freelancer I was able to work with some small bussinesses
                        from both home and abroad. I was able to help them to build websites for them.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="5th-work">mobile-app-development</h2>
                    <p> I was able to give a hand at some of the finest android apps in my county and even
                        from outside world. forexample I have participated in building social media apps like 
                        Tik Tok and also from our home country I was able to participate in the app version of 
                        tele-birr which is an app for ethio telecom(one of the largest organization in the country.)
